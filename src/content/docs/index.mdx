## Next steps

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="ENTERPRISE-GRADE ROUTING" icon="open-book">
		Built on TanStack Router, Start comes pre-packed with a fully type-safe and powerfully-unmatched routing system that is designed to handle the beefiest of full-stack routing requirements with ease.
		Start builds on top of Router's fully inferred type safety to also provide type-safe full-stack APIs that keep you in the fast lane.
	</Card>
	<Card title="SSR, STREAMING AND SERVER RPCS" icon="rocket">
		Who said rich and interactive applications can't have it all? TanStack Start includes powerful capabilities for full-document SSR, streaming, server functions and RPCs. No more choosing between server-side rendering and top-class client-side interactivity. Command the server as you see fit.
	</Card>
	<Card title="CLIENT-SIDE FIRST, 100% SERVER CAPABLE" icon="document">
		While other frameworks continue to compromise on the client-side application experience we've cultivated as a front-end community over the years, TanStack Start stays true to the client-side first developer experience, while providing a full-featured server-side capable system that won't make you compromise on user experience.
	</Card>
	<Card title="DEPLOY ANYWHERE" icon="puzzle">
		TanStack Start can be deployed anywhere JS can run. Whether you're hosting on a traditional server, a serverless platform, or even a CDN, Start seamlessly builds, bundles and deploys your application with ease.
